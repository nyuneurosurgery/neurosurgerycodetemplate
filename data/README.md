## `data`
This directory should house datasets used for experiments, or information indicating how datasets can be assembled and organized in order to execute the provided codebase. 

When possible, this directory should house small samples (< 100 MB) of artificial or de-identified data sets that are a result of individual experiments and/or simulations and can be used to immediately verify functionality of the underlying codebase. 

This is **not** a place to store large data files, and should not be used for the storage of PHI or any proprietary datasets that are not consistent with organizational policies.
